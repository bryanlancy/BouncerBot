# BouncerBot
> Private Discord server management made easy.
> - Find and kick all users without roles
> - Get server summary
>   - \# of members
>   - members without roles

## Setup
- create config.json in bot's root folder
    `{"prefix" : "prefix"}`

- `npm install`

## Command Reference
- type `~help` or `~h` for a list of more commands
- add `help` to the end of a command for help with that command
    - All commands? just help, then help explains the rest?

### _TODO_
- Need to Add:
    - [ ] Standard help message layout
- Code Cleanup:
    - [ ] Condense reminders, move into folder, one file? separate into different files?
    - [ ] Break commands into separate files, modules
